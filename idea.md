The Sechseläuten is a yearly tradition in Zurich taking place in April, where a
straw puppet called «Böög» is burned. The head of this puppet is filled with
firecrackers. It is said that the faster the head explodes, the better the
weather will be in the following summer.

# Data Sets

- [Böögg burning times](https://www.kaggle.com/kkanders/historical-monthly-temperatures-in-switzerland/download)
- [Historical Monthly Precipitation in Switzerland](https://www.kaggle.com/kkanders/historical-monthly-precipitation-in-switzerland/download)

# Research Question

Is there a correlation with the time it takes for the «Böög's» head to explode
and a good weather in the subsequent summer (warm temperatures and low
precipitation)?
